# Class Work

In this repository I have my assignments, notes, and projects from different classes that I have taken while at college.  

The following classes count toward my Bachelors in Computer Engineering at Stevens.  All classes with codes starting with 500 or higher are graduate level classes taken.  

CPE stands for Computer Engineering, EE for Electrical Engineering, and FE for Financial Engineering.
